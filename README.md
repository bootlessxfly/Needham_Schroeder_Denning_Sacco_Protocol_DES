 A discrete Event Simulation written in Java that shows the Needham-Schroeder protocol with Denning Sacco modification
 * This was written for HW # 4 of Comp 6376. 
 * Please do not use this code to complete the assignment for this class. This should be used as a reference only
 * The simulation of this program is built based on the state of each individual Event object
 * The Even logic for this simulation is specific for modeling the Needham-Shroeder protocol with Denning Sacco modification
 * This is a very simple discrete event simulation program and there are most certainly better ways to write a DES.
 * This program simulates the forming of a session key with Cathy(The authenticator). Bob and Alice then initiates a full conversation using this session key
